# UAV Solar PV Benchmark - code

Code accompanying the dataset *"A multimodal multi-altitude UAV dataset with persistent module identifiers for photovoltaic inspection in Vietnam"*.
The dataset itself is distributed separately (Zenodo; see `dataset/README.md` and `dataset/DATA_DICTIONARY.md`); this repository holds the code that built the release tables and the code behind the Technical Validation.

All paths in the scripts are relative to the dataset root unless a `--dataset`, `--out` or similar argument says otherwise. Every script that writes a table says so in its docstring (`python scripts/<name>.py --help` or read the first lines).

## Setup

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Python 3.10 or newer. The QGIS scripts run inside the QGIS Python console, not in this environment. Scripts that need the DJI Thermal SDK (`decode_rjpeg.py`) expect the SDK libraries to be installed separately; the SDK is not redistributed. The baseline script needs `torch` and `ultralytics` (version used for the paper: ultralytics 8.4.198) and a GPU for reasonable run times.

## Layout

| Path | Content |
|---|---|
| `configs/pipeline_config.yaml` | Early pipeline settings (paths, CRS). The split settings in it are superseded by the split scripts below and the tables in `metadata/splits/`. |
| `qgis/` | QGIS console scripts used for the module reference grid (original, unmodified copies): `draw_grid.py`, `module_id.py`, `build_master_gpkg.py`, `editcolor_export.py`. |
| `scripts/` | Processing, split, leakage-check, label and baseline scripts, grouped below. |
| `tools/label_tool/` | Single-file browser tool used to draw and check oriented thermal boxes (`label_tool.html`), and its portable build script (`build_portable.py`). No server is needed; open the HTML file in a browser. |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies of the scripts. |

## Scripts by step

### 1. Organising the raw data and building the inventory
| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `drive_tools.py` | Crawl and resumably download public Google Drive folders. |
| `organise_dataset.py`, `organise_maps.py`, `organise_reports.py` | Move raw images, orthomosaics, DSMs, camera files and processing reports into the dataset layout using the `flight_id` naming rule. |
| `build_image_inventory.py` | EXIF and DJI XMP inventory of every UAV JPG -> `image_inventory.csv`, `flight_summary.csv`. |
| `build_flight_manifest.py` | `flight_manifest.csv` and `thermal_speed.csv`. |
| `xmp_speed_and_flags.py`, `apply_xmp_speed_primary.py` | Cross-check of ground speed from XMP and per-image quality flags; makes the XMP flight-controller speed the primary standard. |
| `build_metadata_field_coverage.py` | Which metadata fields each camera system records, and for how many images. |
| `build_pairing.py` | RGB (W) to thermal (T) pairing table. |
| `register_rgb_thermal.py` | Transfer-error study of the RGB-thermal registration (DJI H20T shots). |

| `parse_metashape_reports.py` | Summarise the Metashape PDF reports into one table. |
| `make_checksums.py` | SHA-256 checksums of the dataset. |

### 2. Thermal decoding and environment context
| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `decode_rjpeg.py` | Decode radiometric R-JPEG frames into temperature matrices with the DJI Thermal SDK (libdirp) through ctypes. |
| `check_thermal_alignment.py` | Pixel alignment of the palette rendering against the decoded temperature matrix. |
| `fetch_environment_context.py` | Hourly reanalysis weather and irradiance per farm and flight (model-based context, not in-situ measurements). |

### 3. Geometry: footprints, ortho checks, reference grid
| Script | What it does |

| `build_footprints.py` | Ground footprint of every image (`image_footprints.gpkg`), overlap report and the first split-leakage audit. |
| `projection_error.py` | Consistency of the frame-to-map projection of single thermal frames (EPSG:32649). |
| `calibrate_with_rtk_points.py` | Evaluate a base orthomosaic against RTK points and propose the correction. |
| `ortho_control_points.py` (+ `orthoreg_common.py`, `orthoreg_match.py`, `orthoreg_register.py`, `orthoreg_figs.py`) | Control points and fitted transform between thermal-flight orthomosaics and the base orthomosaic. |
| `audit_grid.py` | How the reference grid `TN19_modules_master.gpkg` relates to the real modules (image-based, heuristic). |
| `associate_boxes_to_grid.py` | Link TN19 thermal boxes to reference-grid cells. |
| `plot_coverage.py`, `plot_label_coverage.py` | Coverage figures of flights and of labelled frames. |

### 4. Thermal labels
| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `merge_labels.py` | Merge the per-flight ortho-level box files into the dataset annotations. |
| `integrate_frame_labels.py` | Integrate the frame-level labels (YOLO-OBB, one text file per 640 x 512 thermal frame) into the dataset. |
| `frame_vs_ortho_agreement.py` | Consistency between ortho-level and frame-level labels. |
| `box_temperature.py` | Per-box apparent-temperature statistics for `thermal_frame_boxes.csv`. |
| `build_review_package.py`, `review_common.py`, `apply_review_decisions.py` | Second-pass review of the labelled frames: build the review package, apply the decisions as a change report and proposed tables (originals are never overwritten). They work on review files that are not part of the release. |
| `make_agreement_sample.py`, `agreement_metrics.py` | Design of the annotator-agreement sample (blind packages) and the agreement metrics for YOLO-OBB labels (box matching by rotated IoU, class agreement, counts). Both scripts need the private sample key and the blind package files (not released); they are given for transparency. Their outputs are released in `dataset/annotation_agreement/` (labels of A1, A2, A3 and result tables). |
| `build_inspection_cell_layer.py` | Cell-level layer of TN19 (`TN19_inspection_cells.gpkg`, `cell_repeat_flights.csv`) from the box-to-cell association. |

### 5. Splits and leakage checks
| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `make_splits.py` | Pair-level split protocols A-D (deterministic, fixed seed): `metadata/splits/main_spatial_buf*.csv`, `xalt_*`, `xfarm_*`, `tndl_xalt_*`. |
| `make_frame_label_split.py` | Frame-level, leakage-aware split of the 3,000 labelled frames: `frame_label_split*.csv`. Overlap graph of footprints enlarged by a margin (2.3 m, 5 m for BIM2), whole components for the small farms, six ground strips for TN19. |
| `leakage_common.py` | Shared helpers: units (whole frames and crop windows) of a split table and their ground footprints. |
| `leakage_mc.py` | Monte Carlo of the residual leakage under the measured footprint errors. |
| `leakage_images.py` | Image-based check of the cross-split pairs (independent of the footprints). |
| `leakage_margin_table.py`, `leakage_report.py` | Margin-sensitivity table and the consolidated leakage report. |

### 6. Baseline detector (Technical Validation)
| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `make_yolo_dataset_view.py` | Build an ultralytics-style view (`images/`, `labels/`, split lists, `data.yaml`) of the frame-level labels from a split table. `--mode symlink|hardlink|copy|strip` (`strip` writes JPEG copies without the application segments), `--split-table` selects the protocol, `--no-negatives` skips reviewed negative frames. |
| `train_baseline_obb.py` | Baseline oriented-box detector (YOLO11n-obb): 640 px, batch 16, at most 100 epochs, patience 30, one run per seed; the best-validation checkpoint is scored once on the test split. Writes `metrics.json`, `results.csv` and `args.yaml` per seed. |

## Reproducing the baseline tables

1. Build a view for the protocol with `make_yolo_dataset_view.py`:
   - protocol C (main frame-level split): `--split-table metadata/splits/frame_label_split.csv`;
   - protocol A (strip split, 10 m buffer): the table in `metadata/splits/_strip_buffer_strict/` with `--mode strip`;
   - cross-domain (train and validation TN19, test the other farms): `metadata/splits/frame_label_split_xdomain_tn19_to_others.csv`.
2. Train and score with `train_baseline_obb.py --data <view> --out <results> --seeds 0 1 2`. Pass the stems of the background frames with `--neg-names` so that false boxes per background frame are also reported.
3. Frames marked `buffer` or `crop` in a split table are not used as whole frames (see `dataset/README.md`, section 8.1).

The cross-domain diagnosis in the paper (rotated copies of the TN19 training images, training with a share of the target-farm frames) was run on Colab; its notebook generators are not part of this repository.

Background frames: frames without a released box (not confirmed negatives; the main annotator recorded no anomaly), chosen at random with a fixed seed so that none is closer than the split margin to a frame of another part, with a cap per split (train 10 % of the positive training images, val at most 300, test at most 1,000). Their lists are in `dataset/metadata/splits/baseline_background_frames.csv`.

## Notes

- The thermal images in the YOLO views are the 8-bit preview inside the R-JPEG, not temperatures; labels are normalised to the 640 x 512 frame.
- Split and leakage statements in the paper refer to nominal footprints (flat terrain) with the stated margin; they do not prove that no pixel is shared (see Technical Validation).
- Scripts are provided as used for the paper. Several scripts carry hard-coded folder names of the authors' working copy near the top of the file; adjust them to your dataset root before running.
- Several scripts use default folders under `.local/` (a private working folder that is not part of this repository), for example the agreement study inputs or scratch outputs. Pass the corresponding command-line arguments, or point them to the files of the released dataset (annotation_agreement/, metadata/...), to run them on the data downloaded from Zenodo.
